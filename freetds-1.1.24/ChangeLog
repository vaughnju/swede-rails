    tds: More robust conversion from FLT to DECIMAL/NUMERIC

    Conversion follows flt->string->numeric code-path.  In the first step
    (flt->string via `sprintf`) we use `%f` conversion specifier to prevent
    receiving a string with scientific notation back (as is the case,
    potentially, with `%g`).

    Convert DocBook to XML format

    Use xmlto instead of openjade.
    Update main document, style sheet and build files.
    Update documentation.
    Now is not necessary to define DOCBOOK_DSL, if xmlto is found
    the guide is compiled.

    odbc: Change SQL_DESC_OCTET_LENGTH value for wide character columns

    SQL_DESC_OCTET_LENGTH should return the bytes needed for the buffer
    needed to store the default conversion of the column.
    For compatibility the default type for wide character columns
    is SQL_C_CHAR that is the strings will be converted to multi-byte.
    In FreeTDS the charset for multi-byte can be UTF-8 so assuming each
    character will take one byte is wrong.
    Use "max_bytes_per_char" value.

    This fixes issue #305 on GitHub (https://github.com/FreeTDS/freetds/issues/305).

    tds: Fix some issues with server redirection

    Server redirection is a feature used by MSSQL, specially Azure
    to redirect a connection to another server.
    Due to a bug the TLS session was not correctly closed for the
    previous attempt causing the second connection to fail is
    the first was using TLS (which is the common case for MSSQL).
    Another issue was that Azure check the requested "server name"
    field in the login to select the databases to provide.
    Last was that MARS support was possibly disabled by first attempt
    and so MARS support was not enabled for the final connection.

    This fixed https://github.com/FreeTDS/freetds/issues/308

    Extends support for MS XML type

    Make sure MS XML type is supported by CT-Library and DB-Library.
    We need to map this type to a proper library type as MS XML
    is not supported by proprietary libraries (DB-Library was abandoned,
    CT-Library is written for Sybase).

    ct.c (_ct_get_server_type): Handle CS_LONGCHAR_TYPE.

    Map it to SYBVARCHAR when (possibly) using TDS 7+, and to SYBLONGCHAR
    with older protocol versions.  Unconditional use of SYBLONGCHAR would
    result in gratuitous Sybase-style substitution of single spaces for empty
    strings under Microsoft SQL Server, which otherwise leaves them intact.

    Add a comment summarizing the types that remain unhandled.

    tds: Apply character conversion for Sybase

    In FreeTDS 1.0 conversion was moved from server to client.
    However some code was missing to apply the conversion in all
    directions. Apply conversion in all sensing and receiving of data.
    For BCP we now need to use server column size as column_size
    is adjusted for client conversion so can be much bigger than
    server real column size (expected to match for BCP).

    This fixes issue #260 ("handle different encoding when retrieve
    rows got strange chars")

    New CS_DATABASE property

    Microsoft Azure does not allow switching databases after the connection
    has been made, so we need a way to define the database name prior to the
    call to `ct_connect`. Introduce a new, optional CS_DATABASE property
    that can be configured with a string value using `ct_con_props`.

    I have defined the constant / enum as 9302, as it appears that the other
    93XX properties (CS_PORT and CS_CLIENTCHARSET) are also inventions of
    FreeTDS.

    Fix bulk insert multibyte string support in names

    When column name (or table name in blob type case) has non ASCII characters length of such string was calculated incorrectly.
    In such cases bulk insert has failed with:
    Msg 4804, Level 17, State 1
            While reading current row from host, a premature end-of-message was encountered--an incoming data stream was interrupted when the server expected to see more data. The host program may have terminated. Ensure that you are using a supported client application programming interface (API).
